How to build:

Go the the directory of the target you want to build (ShowServer, ShowClient)

Then enter:;
  cmake . -B ./build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
        If building on the Beaglebone, and to get the PRU capability enter
  cmake . -B ./build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBEAGLE=1

  cmake --build ./build --config Release
  
  The executable should now be in the ./build directory
